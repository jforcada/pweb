  <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
  noreferrer">Docker</a> is already present in the server infrastructure of most
  companies. It has become one of the top DevOps technologies in the latest
  years.
</p>

<p>
  We are going to see the basics of how it works, the Linux kernel features that
  make it possible.
</p>

<p>
  Docker adds on top of these capabilities high level features so we do not have
  to deal with the details when working with containers.
</p>

<p>
  What are these parts and how do they work?
</p>

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<h3>What's a linux namespace?</h3>

<p>
  A namespace is a technique to isolate a specific resource from the rest of the
  system. This way, a resource living inside a namespace does not exist to other
  resources living into other namespaces. For example, a process inside
  <code>A</code> namespace can access all the resources in that namespace, but
  will not know about the existence of resources inside <code>B</code> namespace.
</p>

<p>
  Nonetheless, a resource can be in multiple namespaces, so all processes inside
  them will have access to it. For example, a text file.
</p>

<p>
  By default, a Linux system will have one single namespace where all processes
  will get access to all resources. With namespace technology, they can be
  compartmentalized.
</p>

<p>
  Namespaces have a hierarchy. These means that a namespace that descends from
  another, the resources from the descendants can be accessed by the ones in the
  ascendants.
</p>

<h4>What types of namespaces do exist in Linux?</h4>

<p>
  There are multiple types of namespaces in Linux. The type of the namespace
  depends on the resources it is going to isolate, though its purpose is always
  the same.
</p>

<h5>Mount namespace</h5>

<p>
  It is the first namespace type that was implemented in Linux. Its purpose is
  to isolate a set of mount points so they can only be accessed by a group of
  processes.
</p>

<h5>UTS namespace</h5>

<p>
  It isolates two system identifiers, <code>nodename</code> and
  <code>domainname</code>. This allows the group of processes inside the namespace
  to work as if the hostname and domain names were different.
</p>

<h5>IPC namespace</h5>

<p>
  Isolates some communication mechanisms between processes, so inside this
  namespace those mechanisms are only available to the processes of the group
  and have their own set of identifiers.
</p>

<h5>PID namespace</h5>

<p>
  This one is probably the most remarkable, as it allows to isolate the
  processes themselves in an independent set of process identifiers. Each
  namespace has inside its own <code>init</code> process (PID=1). In other words,
  it makes possible to isolate process trees.
</p>

<p>
  This also implies that a process inside a namespace will have 2 PID assigned:
  the one inside the namespace and the outer one. This is because of the hierarchy
  system, the initial namespace can see all the processes that are created from it.
</p>

<h5>Network namespace</h5>

<p>
  This namespace brings isolation to the whole network stack, that is, all the
  resources related to networking: interfaces, IP adresses, routing tables,
  ports, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Each namespace can hold its own independent IP addressing, and so multiple
  processes bind to port 80 as long as they are inside its own namespace. Then
  these ports can be binded to others in the top namespace of the host.
</p>

<h5>User namespace</h5>

<p>
  Isolates users and groups, that inside the namespace get their own identifier.
  These users and groups will get different identifiers outside the namespace.
</p>

<p>
  This allows that a non privileged user in the host, to have permissions inside
  the namespace, so he can run processes and use resource that require
  privileges.
</p>

<h2>What are control groups in Linux?</h2>

<p>
  Linux CGroups are groups that allow the control of resources to the processes
  that belong to them.
</p>

<p>
  Historically the project started as a similar idea to namespaces, but then
  namespaces were developed to cover more use cases. Anyway CGroups are being
  used now together with namespaces.
</p>

<p>
  This combined usage is due to CGroups providing a set of capabilities to the
  system that supplement those of the namespaces. Specifically:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Resource limits</strong>, can be configured in a group so its
    processes do not exceed a specific memory limit, for example.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prioritization</strong>, some groups can have higher priority to
    access system resources, like CPU or Input/Output interfaces.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accounting</strong>, the resources being used can be mesured.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Control</strong>, it is possible to perform actions on all the
    processes of a group at once.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  But more than anything CGroups make sure that no process by itself can take
  down the system by exhausting all its resources.
</p>

<p>
  And like namespaces, CGroups can also have a hierarchy: A group will inherit
  the limits of the parent group.
