          <h3 class="title"><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2005 - 2011 &nbsp;&nbsp; Computer Engineering student at Universitat Jaume I (UJI)</h3>
          <p>
            I studied Computer Engineering in the Universitat Jaume I (UJI) in Castell√≥n, Spain. Focused on software
            engineering and algorithms.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title"><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011 - 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; Software Engineer at TUENTI TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
          <p>
            One of the first projects I work on at the company was a new <strong>sign up system with phone verification</strong> for the
            social network. The project was built using a SMS gateway with security code generation to verify the
            identity of the profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another web project I worked on was the rewrite of the <strong>social events</strong> feature. Rebuilding both, frontend and backend,
            focusing mainly in its scalability to be able to manage the huge load of the site: database denormalization,
            model caching, load balancing, data archiving, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I spent a full year working on the <strong>social network chat</strong>. There were two main projects our team developed: The
            <strong>group chat</strong>, extending the existing one-to-one chat to allow users to create roms with more than two members. And the
            <strong>photo sharing</strong>, with which the users could send their photos through a chat conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also worked for a year and a half on the MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) side of the company. Developing with
            the rest of the acquisition team an <strong>A/B testing framework</strong> for our online store checkout with payment integration,
            identity verification and shipment tracking.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the MVNO, our team also rebuilt the <strong>retail sales tool</strong> to solve security issues, and perform some usability
            improvements from the feedback provided by the sellers. Also improving and standarizing the backend API the
            tool was relying on.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the work on the server side was done in PHP, using an in house web framework and the Symfony 2 framework. On the
            storage side, MySQL, Memcached and HBase were the main tools. We were also relying on Beanstalkd as messaging system and queue
            processing. On the client side, we developed in JavaScript with both jQuery and YUI.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team were managed with Scrum as long as custom methodologies. We did heavy use of continuous integration and
            automated development environments based on Vagrant that mimicked production. High quality testing of every project became a self imposed
            standard.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title"><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 - 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; Software Engineer at QDQ Media</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of joining the company, I developed a sign in solution to bring customers from other companies
            in partnership. It was developed in Python 3 and Django framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next my team analyzed the architecture of the company systems, and decided to start the migration process to a microservices
            architecture. We wanted to start small, and I built the asynchronous <strong>email service</strong> fed up through RabbitMQ
            queues. That also implied to refactor the monolithic architecture to adapt to an asynchronous pattern when using the service.
            The stack used was Python 3 with Django, Postgres and RabbitMQ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing with the microservices approach, I worked on a substitution service for an old call tracking system.
            This time, building a synchronous system with an authenticated HTTP API, so multiple user facing products could benefit
            from the same service easily. The tech here was Node.js with the hapi web framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another big project that I worked on was a full revamp of the in house statistics service. Starting with the frontend
            standarization of the tracking across different projects adapting their templates and building an agnostic client-side
            to automatically start tracking when included. The legacy system was using redis to store the data, and we migrated it
            to Riak KV.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support this kind of infrastructure, we use a private PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) based on docker (like our
            development environments) to quickly release new applications with minimal operations effort. We also established an
            automated release process with continuous integration.
